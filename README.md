# NewPortfolio

This portfolio was stylized using the Materialze Framework.

It uses Scrollspy  and parallax scrolling to allow user to flow between sections.  The cards displaying my different projects are responsive, and if clicked, will display a brief descrition of each project.

I have included links to my github profile and linkedin profile.  I did not include a resume at this point.
